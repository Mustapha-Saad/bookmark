# Bookmark Landing Page

![Design preview for the Bookmark landing page coding challenge](./img/desktop-preview.jpg)

A challenge from Frontend Mentor.

Coded by me! 😁

I tried to focus a little more on making this solution accessible with styled outlines, WAI-ARIA, and dynamic alt text for the changing of the tab images. I was also happy that I got to code more JS in this challenge and think carefully about making my JS DRY. 😀

Some extra touches I added were a Material Design-inspired click effect to the buttons, some simple content animations and transitions using Animate.css again
